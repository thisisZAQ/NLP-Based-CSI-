# NLP-Based-Business-Sentiment-Index-for-India-
A medium frequency business sentiment analysis tool for forecasting economic indicators in India using Natural Language Processing and econometric modeling.

📊 #Overview
This research project develops a Business Sentiment Index (BSI) that leverages advanced NLP techniques and neural networks to analyze business sentiment from news sources and forecast key economic indicators for the Indian economy. The BSI demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional survey-based indices in real-time economic tracking.
🎯 Key Features

High-frequency sentiment analysis from business news sources
Advanced NLP pipeline using refined RoBERTa model with economist persona prompt
Real-time economic forecasting capabilities
Policy-weighted evaluation system that aligns with real-world applications
Open-source toolkit for replication and further research

🔬 Research Findings
Performance Metrics

Economic Causality: Drives economic activity with significant Granger causality (p < 0.05) for 1-month services PMI forecasting
Superior Tracking: F1-score of 0.87 vs. 0.82 for OECD BCI in real-time performance
Policy Alignment: Penalizes false negatives (missed downturns) 3x more than false positives, better reflecting policy concerns
Strong Correlation: Achieves r=0.77 correlation with Composite PMI

🏗️ Architecture
The BSI combines multiple methodologies:

Natural Language Processing: RoBERTa-based sentiment classification
Time-series Econometrics: Advanced forecasting models
Behavioral Economics: Policy-weighted evaluation framework
Neural Networks: Deep learning for pattern recognition
